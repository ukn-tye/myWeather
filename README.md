# myWeather
This is my module 6 assignment. In this assignment I was tasked with creating a weather app that used the ``open weather`` api to grab information. This assignment was really fun to make once I got the hang of it. I was able to finish and complete almost all the requirements without a problem and produce a good looking UI as well. It has features like modern icons, tempature, humidty percentages and more. I hope to build onto this app later on in the future. In terms of design and function, I took a trip back to my module 4 assignment and went with the same theme.
